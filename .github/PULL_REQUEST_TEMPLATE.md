## Pre review checklist

- [ ] Read through the code changes carefully after finishing work
- [ ] Make sure tests pass locally (after every commit!)
- [ ] Prepare changes in small commits for more convenient review (optional)
- [ ] PR title captures the intent of the changes, and is fitting for release notes.
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Ensured new behaviour is tested (opened GUI? screenshots? tried workflows?)

## Pre merge checklist
- [ ] Added appropriate release note label
- [ ] Commit history is consistent and clean, in line with the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/equinor/ert/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
