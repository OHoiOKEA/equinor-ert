Eclipse - or not
================

In the very first versions of ERT it was all about running Eclipse - there was no
general forward model. The concept of general forward model came quite quickly
and since then the special treatment of Eclipse has gradually been reduced. It
is now possible to run a forward model without Eclipse at all, but ERT is still
quite far from a situation where Eclipse is just any other forward model. For
good and for bad there is quite a lot of functionality in ERT which is
specifically targeted at Eclipse.
