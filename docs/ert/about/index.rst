Icon
====

The reason for using a pea pod as an icon serves two purposes.

Firstly, 'ert' is the Norwegian word for pea. Therefore, using a pea pod as an
icon shows the connection to where ert originated, and where most of the development takes place.

Secondly, the pea pod represents a good analogy for ensembles. Like an ensemble,
a pea pod contains different peas that are similar, yet different. So, using a
pea pod as an icon helps to convey the concept of an ensemble in an easily recognizable way.
