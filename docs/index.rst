Welcome to ERT's documentation!
===============================

ERT (Ensemble based Reservoir Tool) is a free and open-source tool for automating complex workflows,
such as uncertainty quantification and data assimilation.
It is heavily used in the petroleum industry for reservoir management and production optimization,
but ERT is a general tool and is used in other domains, such as wind-farm management and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).

For example use cases and the theory behind ensemble-based methods, refer to :doc:`theory/ensemble_based_methods`.
