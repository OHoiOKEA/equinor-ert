.. _Configuring_observations_for_ERT:

Observations
============


General overview
----------------

When using ERT to condition on dynamic data, it is necessary to
specify the data/observations to be used. For every piece of data
ERT needs to know:

 - The measured value of the data.
 - The uncertainty (standard deviation) of the measured data.
 - The time of measurement.
 - How to simulate a response of the data given a parameterized forward model.

This information is configured in an observation file. The name/path
to this observation file is declared in the main ERT config file using the
:ref:`OBS_CONFIG <obs_config>` keyword.

The observation file is a plain text file, and is in essence built around four
different classes of observations using the associated keywords:

 - :ref:`SUMMARY_OBSERVATION <summary_observation>`: For scalar values that
   can be extracted from an ECLIPSE summary file. Examples are rates from
   separator tests, water cut, GOR, shut in pressures, etc.

 - :ref:`GENERAL_OBSERVATION <general_observation>`: All other observations.
   These observations are extracted from ascii files and allows for loading
   of just about anything. Examples: 4D seismic, results from non ECLIPSE
   compatible simulatores, etc.

 - :ref:`HISTORY_OBSERVATION <history_observation>`: For time series of
   observations for which the observed values can be extracted from
   WCONPROD or WCONINJE section of ECLIPSE schedule files. Used for easy / quick
   configuration of production rates and fractions.


Please note that observations and datatypes are quite tightly linked together.
Before reading this you should have a firm grasp of the dynamic data types
as described in :ref:`Data types available in ERT <Data_types_available_in_ERT>`.


.. _summary_observation:

SUMMARY_OBSERVATION keyword
---------------------------

The keyword SUMMARY_OBSERVATION can be used to condition on any
observation for which the simulated value is written to the ECLIPSE
summary file, e.g. well rates, region properties, group and field
rates etc. A typical usage of SUMMARY_OBSERVATION is to condition
on results from separator tests.

In order to create a summary observation, four pieces of information
are needed: The observed value, the observation error, the time of
observation and a summary key. A typical summary observation is
created as follows:

.. code-block:: none

 SUMMARY_OBSERVATION SEP_TEST_2005
 {
    VALUE = 100.0;
    ERROR =     5;
    DATE  = 2005-08-21;
    KEY   = GOPR:BRENT;
 };

This will create an observation of group oil production for the Brent
group on 21th of august 2005. The observed value was 100 with a
standard deviation of 5. The name SEP_TEST_2005 will be used as a
label for the observation within the ERT and must be unique.

Date format YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601) is required.
Other time formats, like DD/MM/YYYY or DD.MM.YYYY, are deprecated
and its support will be removed in a future release.

The item KEY in a SUMMARY_OBSERVATION is used to look up the simulated value
from the summary file. To condition on the summary key VAR in well, group or
region WGRNAME, one uses::

 KEY = VAR:WGRNAME;

For example, to condition on RPPW in region 8, one uses::

 KEY = RPPW:8;

It is also possible to give the observation time as a restart number
using the RESTART item or as time in days from simulation start using
the DAYS item. Use a floating point DAYS item for clock-times.
Here are two examples:

.. code-block:: none

 -- Giving the observation time in terms of restart number.
 SUMMARY_OBSERVATION SEP_TEST_2005
 {
    VALUE    = 100;
    ERROR    =   5;
    RESTART  =  42;
    KEY      = GOPR:BRENT;
 };


 -- Giving the observation time in terms of days
 -- from simulation start.
 SUMMARY_OBSERVATION SEP_TEST_2008
 {
    VALUE    = 213;
    ERROR    =  10;
    DAYS     = 911;
    KEY      = GOPR:NESS;
 };

.. _general_observation:

GENERAL_OBSERVATION keyword
---------------------------

The GENERAL_OBSERVATION keyword is used together with the GEN_DATA and
GEN_PARAM type. This pair of observation and data types are typically
used when you want to update something special which does not fit into
any of the predefined types. The ERT application just treats
GENERAL_OBSERVATION (and also GEN_DATA) as a range of numbers with no
particular structure, this is very flexible, but of course also a bit
more complex to use:

.. code-block:: none

 GENERAL_OBSERVATION GEN_OBS1 {
    DATA     = SOME_FIELD;
    RESTART  = 20;
    OBS_FILE = some_file.txt;
 };


This example shows a minimum GENERAL_OBSERVATION. The keyword DATA
points to the GEN_DATA instance this observation is 'observing',
RESTART gives the report step when this observation is active.
OBS_FILE should be the name of a file with observation values,
and the corresponding uncertainties. The file with observations should
just be a plain text file with numbers in it, observations and
corresponding uncertainties interleaved. An example of an OBS_FILE::

 1.46 0.26
 25.0 5.0
 5.00 1.00

This OBS_FILE has three observations: 1.46 +/- 0.26, 25.0 +/- 5.0 and
5.00 +/- 1.00. In the example above it is assumed that the DATA
instance we are observing (i.e. comparing with) has the same number of
elements as the observation, i.e. three in this case. By using the
keywords INDEX_LIST or INDEX_FILE you can select the elements of the
GEN_DATA instance you are interested in. Consider for example:

.. code-block:: none

 GENERAL_OBSERVATION GEN_OBS1 {
    DATA       = SOME_FIELD;
    INDEX_LIST = 0,3,9;
    RESTART    = 20;
    OBS_FILE   = some_file.txt;
 };

Here we use INDEX_LIST to indicate that we are interested in element
0, 3 and 9 of the GEN_DATA instance::

 GEN_DATA                     GEN_OBS1
 ========                     ===========
 1.56 <---------------------> 1.46  0.26
 23.0        /--------------> 25.0   5.00
 56.0        |    /---------> 5.00  1.00
 27.0 <------/    |           ===========
  0.2             |
 1.56             |
 1.78             |
 6.78             |
 9.00             |
 4.50 <-----------/
 ========

In addition to INDEX_LIST it is possible to use INDEX_FILE which
should just point at a plain text file with indexes (without any ','
or anything). Finally, if your observation only has one value, you can
embed it in the config object with VALUE and ERROR.

Matching GEN_OBS and GEN_DATA
-----------------------------

It is important to match up the GEN_OBS observations with the
corresponding GEN_DATA simulation data correctly. The GEN_DATA result
files must have an embedded '%d' to indicate the report step in them -
in the case of smoother based workflows the actual numerical value
here is not important. To ensure that GEN_OBS and corresponding
GEN_DATA values match up correctly only the RESTART method is allowed
for GEN_OBS when specifying the time. So consider a setup like this:

.. code-block:: none

 -- Config file:
 GEN_DATA RFT_BH67 INPUT_FORMAT:ASCII RESULT_FILE:rft_BH67_%d    REPORT_STEPS:20
 ...                                                       /|\                /|\
 ...                                                        |                  |
 -- Observation file:                                       |                  |
 GENERAL_OBSERVATION GEN_OBS1 {                             +------------------/
    DATA       = RFT_BH67;                                  |
    RESTART    = 20;   <------------------------------------/
    OBS_FILE   = some_file.txt;
 };

Here we see that the observation is active at report step 20, and we
expect the forward model to create a file rft_BH67_20 in each
realization directory.


.. _history_observation:

HISTORY_OBSERVATION keyword
---------------------------

The keyword HISTORY_OBSERVATION is used to condition on observations
fetched from the WCONHIST and WCONINJH keywords in schedule file provided to
the ERT project (or alternatively an ECLIPSE summary file if you have
changed the HISTORY_SOURCE keyword in the ERT project). The keyword
is typically used to condition on production and injection rates for
groups and wells, as well as bottom hole and tubing head pressures. An
observation entered with the HISTORY_OBSERVATION keyword will be
active at all report steps where data for the observation can be
found.

In its simplest form, a history observation is created as follows::

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WOPR:P1;

This will condition on WOPR in well P1 using a default observation
error. The default observation error is a relative error of 10% to the
measurement with a minimum error of 0.10. See below on how explicitly
set the error.

In general, to condition on variable VAR in well or group WGNAME, one
uses::

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION VAR:WGNAME;

Note that there must be a colon ":" between VAR and WGNAME and that
the statement shall end with a semi-colon ";". Thus, to condition on
WOPR, WWCT and WGOR in well C-17, and for the GOPR for the whole
field, one would add the following to the observation configuration:

.. code-block:: none

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WOPR:C-17;
 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WWCT:C-17;
 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WGOR:C-17;

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION GOPR:FIELD;

By default, the observation error is set to 10% of the observed value,
with a minimum of 0.10. It can be changed as follows:

.. code-block:: none

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION GOPR:FIELD
 {
    ERROR       = 1000;
    ERROR_MODE  = ABS;
 };

This will set the observation error to 1000 for all observations of
GOPR:FIELD. Note that both the items ERROR and ERROR_MODE as well as
the whole definition shall end with a semi-colon.

The item ERROR_MODE can take three different values: ABS, REL or
RELMIN. If set to REL, all observation errors will be set to the
observed values multiplied by ERROR. Thus, the following will
condition on water injection rate for the whole field with 20%
observation uncertainity:

.. code-block:: none

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION GWIR:FIELD
 {
    ERROR       = 0.20;
    ERROR_MODE  = REL;
 };

If you do not want the observation error to drop below a given
threshold, say 100, you can use RELMIN and the keyword ERROR_MIN:

.. code-block:: none

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION GWIR:FIELD
 {
    ERROR       = 0.20;
    ERROR_MODE  = RELMIN;
    ERROR_MIN   = 100;
 };

Note that the configuration parser does not threat carriage return
different from space. Thus, the following statement is equivalent to
the previous:

.. code-block:: none

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION GWIR:FIELD { ERROR = 0.20; ERROR_MODE = RELMIN; ERROR_MIN = 100; };

Also note that the special keyword include can be used to read an
external file. This can be very useful if you want to change the
standard configuration for a lot of observations in one go. For
example, consider the following code:

.. code-block:: none

 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WOPR:P1 { include "hist_obs_wells.txt"; };
 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WOPR:P2 { include "hist_obs_wells.txt"; };
 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WOPR:P3 { include "hist_obs_wells.txt"; };
 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WOPR:P4 { include "hist_obs_wells.txt"; };
 HISTORY_OBSERVATION WOPR:P5 { include "hist_obs_wells.txt"; };

Where the contents of the file hist_obs_wells.txt may be something
like:

.. code-block:: none

 ERROR_MODE  = RELMIN;
 ERROR       = 0.25;
 ERROR_MIN   = 100;

In this case, changing the file hist_obs_wells.txt will affect all of
the observations.

By default, an observation entered with the HISTORY_OBSERVATION
keyword will get the observed values, i.e. the 'true' values, from the
WCONHIST and WCONINJH keywords in the schedule file provided to the
ERT project. However it is also possible to get the observed values from
a reference case. In that case you must set HISTORY_SOURCE
variable in the ERT configuration file, see Creating a configuration
file for ERT.

To change the observation error for a HISTORY_OBSERVATION for one or
more segments of the historic period, you can use the SEGMENT
keyword. For example:

.. code-block:: none

  HISTORY_OBSERVATION GWIR:FIELD
  {
     ERROR       = 0.20;
     ERROR_MODE  = RELMIN;
     ERROR_MIN   = 100;

     SEGMENT FIRST_YEAR
     {
        START = 0;
        STOP  = 10;
        ERROR = 0.50;
        ERROR_MODE = REL;
     };

     SEGMENT SECOND_YEAR
     {
        START      = 11;
        STOP       = 20;
        ERROR      = 1000;
        ERROR_MODE = ABS;
     };
  };

The items START and STOP set the start and stop of the segment in
terms of ECLIPSE restart steps. The keywords ERROR, ERROR_MODE and
ERROR_MIN behave like before. If the segments overlap, they are
computed in alphabetical order.
