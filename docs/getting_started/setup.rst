Setup
=====

If you work at Equinor you should have ert available after sourcing a komodo release. Run the command::

    source /prog/res/komodo/stable/enable

Then you can test the installation by running::

    ert --help

If you get a message explaining how to use ERT, you are ready.

If not, you can install ert from PyPi into your own environment::

    $ pip install ert

If you want to build and install the latest development version, please see the `ERT Github page <https://github.com/equinor/ert>`_.
