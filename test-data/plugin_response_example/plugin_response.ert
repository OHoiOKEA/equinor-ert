-- mock the csv response into runpath
FORWARD_MODEL COPY_FILE(<FROM>=dummy_csv_response.csv,<TO>=<RUNPATH>/dummy_csv_response.csv)

-- (not implemented)
-- (probably most complicated to implement)
-- these keywords are added to the ert config before parsing by the "plugin" response
-- implicit primary key by header, it is set at runtime after reading a response,
-- and must thus also defer the observation parsing/validation (if using only <ON_RESPONSE_NAME>)
-- CSV_RESPONSE(<NAME>=RESP_NAME,<SRC>=dummy_csv_response.csv)

-- (planned to be implemented)
-- (easy to implement)
-- explicitly state primary key (will assert that specified primary key matches header)
CSV_RESPONSE(<NAME>=RESP_NAME,<SRC>=dummy_csv_response.csv,<PRIMARY_KEY>=["x","y","z","w","t"])

-- (planned to be implemented)
-- (difficult if response name isn't known until post running forward model)
-- (would not let us do observation validation before
-- explicitly give response name
CSV_OBSERVATION(<OBSERVATIONS_CSV>=dummy_csv_obs.csv,<ON_RESPONSE_NAME>=RESP_NAME)

-- (not implemented)
-- (difficult if response name isn't known until post running forward model)
-- implicitly match response & primary key by header
-- all responses must be of same type, which sort of makes sense as they have the same primary key in csv
-- lookup response type for response name, and expect the columns to match the primary key of that type
-- CSV_OBSERVATION(<OBSERVATIONS_CSV>=dummy_csv_obs.csv,<RESPONSE_NAME_COLUMN>=response_name_col)

-- (not implemented)
-- (difficult if response name isn't known until post running forward model)
-- Will expect header to match that of response type of "FOPR" which is summary
-- sets response_type to summary after reading and parsing line in csv config
-- CSV_OBSERVATION(<OBSERVATIONS_CSV>=summary_csv_obs.csv,<ON_RESPONSE_NAME>=FOPR)


-- (not implemented)
-- expect header to contain column "response_name"
-- expect response names in column to all be of type summary
-- sets response_type to summary on runtime after reading and parsing the line in the csv config
-- CSV_OBSERVATION(<OBSERVATIONS_CSV>=summary_csv_obs.csv,<ON_RESPONSE_TYPE>=summary)

-- (not implemented)
-- Will assert that "FOPR" is of the response type "summary"
-- CSV_OBSERVATION(<OBSERVATIONS_CSV>=summary_csv_obs.csv,<ON_RESPONSE_TYPE>=summary,<ON_RESPONSE_NAME>=FOPR)
